Hello eveyone! I'm Umang Sardesai and currently doing my Masters in Computer Science at **University of California, Santa Cruz**. I received my undergraduate degree from D.J. Sanghvi College of Engineering (**University of Mumbai**) in Computers as well. 

My interests are **Distributed Systems** and **Databases**, **Big Data** and **Data Engineering** in general and I look forward to working on projects in these fields. Along with that, I also try to upskill myself with the latest technology stacks that are required from a full-stack developer today. 

Prior to my Masters, I worked for 2 years at **BrowserStack** as a Product Specialist.    

My goal is to learn something new everyday. Awaiting challenges that lie ahead!

Well... that was enough professional and academic info, here's more on the personal front:   

- I'm a mixture of introvert and extrovert (tending more towards extrovert). Love talking and getting to know more about people around me.
- Sports Afficionado. Cricket üèè is primary love, then football (No! Not *American football* football, *soccer* football ‚öΩ). Miss reading the sports page of our daily newspaper back in India. 
- Looovee Gaming and born Gamer üéÆ. Known to break high-scores on friends‚Äô smartphones. Counter Strike and Age of Empires FTW. 
- Have been in love with Computers right since childhood and really stoked of having the oppurtunity to do a masters in CS right now.
- Techie guy and used to write to articles on Android. 
- Takes the initiative to make plans. May it be a movie or going to a nearby cafe/restaurant.  
- Can listen to any type of music. Like EDM though. Also, love to Dance üï∫.
- Dog person üê∂ but might get myself a Guinea Pig one day. Love animals in general.
- Born and bought up in Mumbai and (at the time of writing this) it's been only six months in the US of A. 
- I hail from Goa üå¥. Can speak fluently in English, Hindi, Marathi and Konkani. 
- I happen to spend half of my time reading 9GAG posts and the comments on it. Sometimes hate myself for that.
